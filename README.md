## Ohmine Dark Theme
The design inspiration is come from the below Japanese Sake Ohmine-3-Grain: 

This is a gift from my friend and I was tasting it when I making this theme. I pretty much love the whole design series of Ohmine-3-Grain and this is originally designed by *Stockholm Design Lab*.

## Sticky Notes
Here I created 7 custom elements for sticky notes: note , tip , question , explain , warning , keyword , important.
Let’s see what are the sticky notes for:
### How to use
3 things you should know before you use the sticky notes:

1. Sticky notes *will not display on printing*, it's for personal use by default. In case you want to print it out, you may need to edit a bit of CSS code in the `userstyle.css` file.
2. Make sure there is a blank line *before the open tag*, otherwise it may cause the format problem.
Code Sample:

Output:

3. Or, if you want to use markdown codes inside the sticky notes, you should add a blank line *before and after the open tag*:
Code Sample:

Output:

## Art Gallery

This art gallery providing 5 custom elements for you:
|Custom Elements|Columns Limit|Gallery Size|Scrolling Trigger|
|:----------:|:-------:|:------------:|:----------:|
|ag2|2|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|2 images above|
|ag3|3|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|6 images above|
|ag4|4|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|12 images above|
|ag5|5|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|20 images above|
|ag6|6|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|30 images above|

Below is the sample of art gallery(ag6) with 48 images: 

### How to use

3 things you should know before you use the art gallery:

1. The custom element name `ag` stands for *Art Gallery*.
2. The art gallery tag must use *right behind the plain text.*
3. Do not including any blank line within this part of codes, *blank line will break the markdown syntax.*

## Abstract Content Bar
Identify elements automatically through the color bar in the markdown editor.
This is the color line which is on the right of the markdown editor. It will check your text line by line and tell you what they are by the colors:
- plain text <span style="color:#383838;">(color sample)</span>
- heading <span style="color:#ffffff6e;">(color sample)</span>
- web link & file path link <span style="color:#cdd286;">(color sample)</span>
- footnote <span style="color:#5a5800;">(color sample)</span>
- abbreviation <span style="color:#da8d00;">(color sample)</span>
- attached image <span style="color:#008e156e;">(color sample)</span>
- code block <span style="color:#101413;">(color sample)</span> <-- same as code block background
- html tag <span style="color:#ff0063;">(color sample)</span>
- math notation <span style="color:#5aa5fb;">(color sample)</span>
- ordered & unordered list <span style="color:#b11da9;">(color sample)</span>
- checklist <span style="color:#5d00ff;">(color sample)</span>
- blank line <span style="color:#151b1a;">(color sample)</span> <-- same as background, (turn off by defualt)

See the below example screenshot (look to the right):

It would be helpful when you want to release your eyes from the text for sometimes, or when you are going to double-check the missing part of your content.

### How to use

Just typing, as usual, it will be automatically appearing at the end of the line. The only thing you may need to do is to understand those colors' meanings.

## Structural-friendly heading style

Here showing the heading samples:



### How to use

Due to the styles of heading structure , something you may need to consider when everytime you are going to use the H4 heading: 

1. If H4 heading is the last level heading of you article, use H4.
2. If not, use the H5 to replaced the H4 to create better reading experience.

## Font Family

Ohmine dark theme is using the below font family for both markdown editor and render viewer:
- Montserrat
This is the most recommended font for this theme, you can download it for free at: (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
- Microsoft JHengHei Light (for Traditional Chinese 繁體中文)

## Printing

Here are few things you should know before you print out your article:

1. Sticky Notes will not appear in the content by default.
2. Art Gallery will be releasing the overflow limit and listing out all the images.
3. A lot of HTML elements are restyled for printing.
4. I created a few print control properties in the `root:` section of `userstyle.css`, you can easily to manage what should print out.

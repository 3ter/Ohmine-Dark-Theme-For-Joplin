## Ohmine Dark Theme
The design inspiration comes from the below Japanese Sake Ohmine-3-Grain: 


![Ohmine-3-Grain_500](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134671847-8748e277-1bbf-4c2a-9ad4-14899f09e12e.png)



This is a gift from my friend and I was tasting it when I making this theme. I pretty much love the whole design series of Ohmine-3-Grain and this is originally designed by *Stockholm Design Lab*.

<img width="520" alt="ohmine-3-grain-reference_800" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134672093-8a9a0405-d9a1-4c7c-9d90-0ac4002c9545.png">

## Notebook Panel

First to take a look at the notebook panel of Ohmine Dark Theme:

![notebook_panel_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134758745-81736f74-97bf-49e2-9779-2fb935085120.png)

The CSS styling of Ohmine Dark Theme will only support up to 10 levels of subdirectories when Joplin didn't limit it to you. And sure, you can edit my CSS by yourself.


## Sticky Notes
Ohmine Dark Theme has 7 custom elements for creating the sticky notes: `note` , `tip` , `question` , `explain` , `warning` , `keyword` , `important`.

Let’s see what are the sticky notes for:


![sticky_notes_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134674480-1283d933-bd48-46f2-a2f8-1fbf8c42dd17.png)


### How to use

3 things you should know before you use the sticky notes:

1. Sticky notes *will not display on printing*, it's for personal use by default. In case you want to print it out, you may need to edit a bit of CSS code in the `userstyle.css` file.
2. Make sure there is a blank line *before the open tag*, otherwise it may cause the format problem.

**Code Sample:**
 ```
 
 <note> 
 here to type any of your content.
 </note>
 ```
**Output:**

![sticky_notes_sample_output1_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134674519-d88f0cee-ee9d-41e0-85a2-2d2e103ce0f5.png)

3. Or, if you want to use markdown codes inside the sticky notes, you should add a blank line *before and after the open tag*:

**Code Sample:**
```

<keyword>

| A | B | C | D |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
</keyword>
```
**Output:**

![sticky_notes_sample_output2_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134674577-10aada6e-4037-474b-bab6-018141f21d45.png)

## Art Gallery

This art gallery providing 5 custom elements for you:
|Custom Elements|Columns Limit|Gallery Size|Scrolling Trigger|
|:----------:|:-------:|:------------:|:----------:|
|ag2|2|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|2 images above|
|ag3|3|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|6 images above|
|ag4|4|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|12 images above|
|ag5|5|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|20 images above|
|ag6|6|W:100% * H:60vh + Scroll|30 images above|

Below is the sample of the art gallery(ag6) with 48 images: 

![art_gallery_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134674614-dfb4a385-882c-4bb0-a05d-3d3d401dbdae.png)

### How to use

3 things you should know before you use the art gallery:

1. The custom element name `ag` stands for *Art Gallery*.
2. The art gallery tag must use *right behind the plain text.*
3. Do not including any blank line within this part of codes, *blank line will break the markdown syntax.*

**Code Sample:**
 
 ```
 This is a normal paragraph content. <--

## Abstract Content Bar

Abstract Content Bar helps you to identify the elements through the color bar in the markdown editor.

It will check your text line by line and then tell you what they are:

(bigger number means higher priority)

![color_sample_of_abstract_content_bar_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134675374-5fea2921-0471-474b-8835-26ddbc3683d5.png)

See the below example screenshot (look to the right):

![abstract_content_bar_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134760098-806290da-3515-42e4-80c2-a5a23a44c887.png)

It would be helpful when you want to release your eyes from the text for sometimes, or when you are going to double-check the missing part of your content.

### How to use

3 things you should know before use:
1. If there is more than one element in the same line, it would be showing the color depends on their priority. You can go back to check the color sample list.
2. The priority is changed in the latest update, you are not able to see "a link within a list" in the previous version.
3. The only thing you may need to do is to understand those colors' meanings.

## Structural-friendly heading style

Here showing the heading samples:

![headings_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134675579-30beeb52-3886-4641-b79b-d426331c08b6.png)

### How to use

Due to the style of headings, something you may need to consider when every time you are going to use the H4 heading: 

1. If the H4 heading is the last level heading of your article, use H4.
2. If not, use the H5 to replaced the H4 to create a better reading experience.

[:arrow_up:Back](https://github.com/Nacandev/Ohmine-Dark-Theme-For-Joplin#table-of-contents)

## Eye-Protector

All the attached images will be defaulted by 30% darker than the original to avoid the bright light flashing your eyes when scrolling down your note.

![eye-protector-sample](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134763020-4662fedb-6bc0-404d-bafc-e16ea5b2ea62.jpg)

Mouse hover on the image to check out the original color, it will be getting bright smoothly.

### Font Family

Ohmine dark theme is using the below font family for both markdown editor and render viewer:

- Montserrat - the most recommended font for this theme
  download it for free at (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat)
- Microsoft JHengHei Light (for Traditional Chinese 繁體中文)
- Avenir (default)
- Arial (default)
- Sans-Serif (default)

Montseratt sample:

![montserrat_font_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134675707-a3c36272-7219-4fba-9079-f4aa65c20d48.png)

And the monospace font family for codes is:
(it's for code block & inline code only)

- Cascadia Mono Light
  download it for free at: (https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code/releases)
- Monospace (default)
- Microsoft JHengHei Light (for Traditional Chinese comments 繁體中文註釋)

Cascadian Mono Light sample:

![cascadia_mono_light_font_sample_abg](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86870826/134675876-8e6a1593-fbb9-4117-8c91-141a45e1d5dc.png)

If you didn't install the ==Montserrat== , ==Microsoft JHengHei Light== or ==Cascadia Mono Light== on your computer, Joplin will pick the default fonts automatically.

>Ohmine Dark Theme used Montserrat font on both Markdown Editor and the Render Viewer. And I must say that the non-monospace font will cause a little problem when you are trying to select a multiple-line heading by your cursor on the Markdown Editor.
>
>Honestly, it will never be a reason to make me choose the other fonts. I've tested over 40 fonts with sizes from 12px to 15px on this theme. And the Montserrat font is the ultimate champion! I think it's providing me the best reading experience by the 14px font size. It's worth me spending over 6 hours a day to work with it!
